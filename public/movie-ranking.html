<h1>The best movies according to Kess</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I love this movie because in my oponion it has the best story line ever and it is action packed. One movie to rule them all, haha.</p>
<h3>2. Wretch it Raph</h3>
<p>This is an animated movie about Raph who is a villian in a game who wretch things and never gets any medal as expected, but all of that changed when he set out of his own game into another game in search of a medal. I will give this movie a 9/10.
    <h3>3. Naruto</h3>
    <p>This Japanese anime has got it all, from action, good story line, intrigue and the songs are out of this world. i could watch this anime all day.</p>
